A fun idea I had for my application is to make a fun cookie clicker game. There's nothing too crazy about it, just keep on clicking the center object and leveling up the more you do it to gain points faster and earn the highest spot on the scoreboard. It's very useful when you have nothing else to do and you want to find an easy way to be the best. Styles of this type of game, such as make it rain, were very popular back in the day and would be a fun idea to bring it back today!

## Key Features
You start of basic with a point per click on the cookies. As you rack up more points, you can upgrade your cookie with the points you have to earn more points per click or you can use your points to buy items that with automatically add to your point counter every second. You can see if you've made it to the leaderboard by checking the highscores.
