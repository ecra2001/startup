There's nothing too crazy about it, just keep on clicking the center object and leveling up the more you do it to gain points faster and earn the highest spot on the scoreboard. It's very useful when you have nothing else to do and you want to find an easy way to be the best. Styles of this type of game, such as make it rain, were very popular back in the day and would be a fun idea to bring it back today!",
